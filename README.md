# special-series
#Defined a loop ranging from 1 to 1 million
#Another loop which excutes if the number is greater than 1
#In case of even numbers, it is divided by 2 and in case of odd numbers, 3*n+1 is done
#count is noted for the number of times loop is executed which is the length of the series
#Index of the loop is stored in 'tmp' which is then passed onto 'index' when the length is maximum
#The length of the series and number is printed
